# _*My family*_
My name is *Margarita* and I have a husband name *Josef* and to daughters *Lihi* 7.3  years old and *Abigail* 3.10 years old.
We came here from Israel on April 2017, and it took several months for kids to disconnect from the familiar things and accept the good things San Diego has to offer 
My daughter *Lihi* very interesting in everything I'm doing so I made her promise that I won't disappoint her in anything.. Well I'm trying ;)
The youngest daughter *Abigail* in preschool and very liked it..
My husband *Josef* he is working in desalination plant, actually we came here because of his work on a 3 years contract (hopefully to stay).
# _*Career*_
I worked in a big company in IT Integration and testing field which was most of it to help others to do their jobs when they tried to deal with technical difficulties , and provide answers to managers about technical issues. 
I was traveling abroad a lot from my work and liked it a lot.. It wasn't easy to leave my work and move to another country.. but here I'm trying to see the positive side.
I'm grateful for the opportunity to study in this class and hopefully will continue further to php, imcp , etc..
